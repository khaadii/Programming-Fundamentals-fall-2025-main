//For each of the following, write a single statement that performs the indicated task. Assume that
//long integer variables value1 and value2 have been defined and that value1 has been initialized
//to 200000.
//a) Define the variable lPtr to be a pointer to an object of type long.
//b) Assign the address of variable value1 to pointer variable lPtr.
//c) Print the value of the object pointed to by lPtr.
//d) Assign the value of the object pointed to by lPtr to variable value2.
//e) Print the value of value2.
//f) Print the address of value1.
//g) Print the address stored in lPtr. Is the value printed the same as the address of value1?
